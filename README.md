# Abstract

Tourist guiding has an important and multifaceted role in contemporary tourism. A safe and quality experience offered by a guided tour involves the guide, tourists and the environment, and is fulfilled when all the three components interact at the same point in space and time. The role of guides in the tourism system distinguishes itself by its potential to manage and orchestrate tourist experiences, enhance destination image and implement the goals of responsible tourism. What guides present and interpret takes effect on the way in which their customers experience a place or attraction, understand local culture, engage in local activities and how they behave on the spot. As front-line professionals, information-givers and interpreters, the guides act as destination's representatives and "ambassadors" in the eyes of tourists. Tourist guiding is one of the important factors of successful presentation of destinations in contemporary tourism, affecting the resulting economic and social benefits *[[1]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337843300_TOURIST_GUIDES_IN_CONTEMPORARY_TOURISM)*.

# Introduction

Tourism industry bodies perceive a tourist guide’s role as providing not only direction but 
also cultural and environmental interpretation at a site (Lackey, 2016). Moscardo (2014) 
implies that interpretation is an integral part of guiding. According to Pond (1993), the 
goals of interpretation are to convey the magnificence of a place, to inspire visitors and 
ultimately to convince them of the need to preserve lands. However, in tourism research, 
interpretation in tour guiding has previously not received the attention it deserves
probably due to critiques that have been made about tour guiding as a profession (Ap & 
Wong, 2001:551). Although some researchers have paid attention to this topic (Cohen, 
1985; Pond, 1993; Van Loggerenberg, Saayman & Kruger, 2015; Lackey, 2016; Látková,
Jordan, Vogt, Everette & Aquino, 2017), this literature does not capture the intricacies of 
tourist guides’ interpretation role. Interpretation provides the sociological, educational
and cultural underpinning of guiding. Cohen (1985) posits that interpretation is the 
essence of the cultural-mediating role of tourist guides. Interpretation during the guided 
tour is the foundation of what any good tourist guide should be doing. The interpretive 
skills of tourist guides can enhance the quality of visitors’ experiences and their 
understanding of an attraction and its culture (Van Loggerenberg et al., 2015; Lackey, 
2016). Consequently, this study aims to explore tourist guides’ role in interpretation as 
perceived by secondary school teachers. To address the main aim of this study these 
two objectives have to be met; (1) to determine secondary school teachers’ satisfaction 
with the principles of interpretation and (2) to determine how important the principles of 
interpretation are to secondary school teachers. The chosen sites for this study are 
Maropeng and the Sterkfontein Caves in South Africa. These two attractions form part 
of the Cradle of Humankind (COH). Maropeng á Afrika (PTY) Ltd is a company that 
operates these two attractions (Maropeng and the Sterkfontein Caves). Both sites have 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World 
Heritage Site status. Maropeng is the official visitor centre of the Cradle of Humankind 
World Heritage Site (COHWHS) and the Sterkfontein Caves is one of the fossil sites 
within the COH *[[2]](https://www.ajhtl.com/uploads/7/1/6/3/7163688/article_21_vol_7__1__2018.pdf)*.

# Research Methodology

This study employed a quantitative approach. Respondents were selected by means of 
non-probability convenience sampling. Data was collected through a self-administered 
questionnaire from secondary school teachers who participated in guided school tours 
at Maropeng and/or the Sterkfontein Caves during the months of March and April 2016.
Before conducting the survey, each school teachers’ permission was obtained. The 
respondents were advised that they could withdraw at any time and that they would 
remain anonymous throughout. The questionnaire was benchmarked against similar 
studies undertaken in Australia and elsewhere (Weiler & Walker, 2014; Moscardo, 2017). 
There was therefore a considerable degree of confidence that the questionnaire’s 
constructs (six principles of interpretation) were stable because all constructs proved to 
be reliable and valid in this study, Weiler & Walker’s (2014) study and Moscardo’s (2017) 
study. In addition, care was taken to adapt specific aspects to the guided school tours at 
Maropeng and the Sterkfontein Caves.
Cronbach’s alpha was used to assess the internal consistency reliability and all variables 
proved to be consistent. Since validity is an unending process, to ensure construct 
validity for this study, the questionnaire was submitted to ten experienced researchers 
within the tourism industry for a pilot study. The population for this study was 350 
secondary teachers. The total number of 250 questionnaires comprised the sample and 
were handed to secondary school teachers and only 202 (n=202) questionnaires were 
usable  *[[2]](https://www.ajhtl.com/uploads/7/1/6/3/7163688/article_21_vol_7__1__2018.pdf)*.

* using PDO take me some other security resources like this question in stack over flow by **using prepare rather than query**.

    - [Stack over flow answeare by](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5108414/mysqli-query-vs-prepare#:~:text=Prepared%20statements%20are%20preferable%20to%20plain%20SQL%20queries,plain%20query%20or%20prepared%20statement%20are%20functionally%20equivalent):


        * Prepare (use by pdo) VS Query ( use by mysqli ) ?

            * Answear By:

```

Answeared By Popular Answear Question: Michael Berkowski (( 260k *45 gold * 430 silver * 377 bronze ))

```

**Prepared statements are preferable to plain SQL queries when you are using parameters to dynamically generate the query. In you example, your SQL contains no variables, so using a plain query or prepared statement are functionally equivalent**.

**When you must change the values of parameters, in the WHERE clause, for example, then prepared statements will give you added security**:
  
    // ...
    // WHERE col1 = ? AND col2 = ?

* **when your query is simple and fixed, it may require less code to use $mysqli->query($sql) along with fetch_assoc()**. 

* **Using direct queries rather than prepared statements is not a universally bad practice, as some might have you believe**. 

* **When your query requires parameterization**, or **when the same query must be compiled and executed repeatedly**, 
**then you'll benefit from the prepared statement**.

# Conclusion

The main aim of this paper was to explore the role of tourist guides in interpretation as 
perceived by secondary school teachers. The results indicated that secondary school 
teachers are generally satisfied with the way in which guides at Maropeng and/or the 
Sterkfontein Caves, apply ‘best practice’ principles of interpretation as described in 
Western texts (Moscardo, 1996). This might be attributed to the fact that many World 
Heritage Sites have incorporated the notion of interpretation in order to attain the 
valuable World Heritage Area status (Ballantyne et al., 2013). Overall, teachers further 
perceived the principles of interpretation to be important. 
As indicated in Table 2, respondents perceived ‘The tour provides novelty and variety’ 
important, and some of the respondents were dissatisfied with this attribute. This could 
be a result of some tourist guides conducting tours according to the manuscript without 
providing explicit explanation of the scientific terms. The findings suggest that some tour 
guides do not engage in back-and-forth questions and answers with the learners and 
teachers. Maropeng á Afrika should therefore introduce peer evaluation among tourist 
guides. This assessment would help guides to enhance the novelty and variety of their 
tours. It is therefore strongly recommended that tourist guides should encourage learners 
and teachers to be interactive by engaging them in back-and-forth questions and 
answers; this would help guides to check the audiences’ understanding of the topics and 
concepts that are central to their tour. The results of this study will inform tourist attraction
marketers about secondary school teachers’ satisfaction on tourist guides’ interpretation 
and how important interpretation is to the respondents. In addition, the results will 
hopefully help the attractions to improve their offerings through guided school tours to 
these important sites *[[3]](https://nmssanctuaries.blob.core.windows.net/sanctuaries-prod/media/archive/management/pdfs/Day7_INDUSTRY_MANUAL.pdf)*.
